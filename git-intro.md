# Git Intro
Over the years developers have created a system that helps them with version control. Originally this was locally on their own hard drive, then centrally on a storage system, then distribued that not only allows everything to be hosted centrally but also to keep files safe if the centralize version control system goes down. This has allowed for developers to have mirred repositories and collaborate with much more ease and agility. This is where Git come in.

Git is a distributed system creating snapshots of changes making it easy for development teams to access prior version and troubleshoot when debugging. On top of the mirrored repositories, Git acts as a gatekeeper for the main file and will look for any file corruption or data loss in the development process, and makes it easy to reverse to or find previous code. 

There are different ways to set up Git on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux (see [source](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#7_2) for setup guide). Once installed, you can configure Git with default or third-party graphical clients, adjust control aspects of the operations and look, and set the identity. You want to take the time to attune Git to your computer, text editor, and needs for use. 

Once these are all set, you are ready to get started with setting up a Git repository. This entails importing the project you'll be working on or cloning an existing repository from a server, such as GitHub. From here you will be able to make and save changes and push these changes to the main repository. 

It sounds way more intense than it really is. A little work up front is work it to create a reliable system to manage the code you'll be working on.
