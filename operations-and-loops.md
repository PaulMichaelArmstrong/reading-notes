# Operations And Loops
In [Programming With JavaScript](/programming-with-javascript) we talked about how there are expression and operators used to make up your JaveScript to get a desired outcome. There are oodles of types of expressions and operators to do that. Here is a rundown of types of operators you can use:

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators

Once you have your operations set up, you may want to look them in case you need to do something repeatedly. There are a handful of different types of loops:

- for statement
- do...while statement
- while statement
- labeled statement
- break statement
- continue statement
- for...in statement
- for...of statement

See sources for a detailed explaination of each type of operator and loops.
