# Programming With JavaScript
Programming with JavaScript is made up of expressions and operators - basically what you are trying to get the computer to do and how you are getting it to do that. This follows a control flow which is a similar concept to orders of operations in math. You can take these expressions and operators and group them together to make a function. When you use a function, you can invocate (call) it multiple times as needed. The function ends when it "returns" giving you the desired outcome - if everything is coded up correctly. 

Here is a very simple example of a fucntion that is set up with a field and submit:

```
function formSubmit(){ 
    if (field==empty) {
        promptUser();
    } else {
        submitForm();
    }
}
```
