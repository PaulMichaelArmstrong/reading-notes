# The Coder's Computer
If you're going to get into coding there is a set of tools that you need to have and/or be comfortable with: the text-editor and the terminal. Let's dive into each one.

### Text-Editor
This is what you are going to be editing code on, and there are oodles out there to choose from. You want to make sure that you at least have the key features. The Old Coder says in his blog post, [_Choosing a Text Editor_](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) to look for code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes, and wide variety of extensions. You computer probably has a text editor on it already, but they don't have the previously mentioned features that will supercharge your code writing.

With that said, you will want to a third-party editor. But which one?! Let's break down some of the most popular options:

Editor | OS | Price | Features
--- | --- | --- | ---
Notepad++ | Windows | Free | Syntax highlighting, code completion, word completion, funcion completion, zoom, online community, chat room, and searchable wiki page
BB Edit | Mac | Free for basic, $49.99 for premium features | From the creators of TextWrangler, compare free and premium features [here](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/comparison.html)
Visual Studio Code | Windows, Mac, Linux | Free | Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS, syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, and code completion
Atom | Windows, Mac, Linux | Free | From the creators of Github, syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, code completion
Brackets | Windows, Mac, Linux | Free | From Adobe, live preview, syntax highlighting, themes, extensions, code completion - only supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Sublime Text | Windows, Mac, Linux | $99 | See full list of features [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/download)

These are all text-editors. There are also IDEs (Intergrated Development Environment) out there and those are text-editors as well as file manager, compiler and debugger all wrapped up into one.

### Terminal
The terminal - also know as the command line - is the text-based interface to your computer. Think of it like reading the Matrix of your Finder. Each teriminal has a sheel which is what defines how the terminal works. This all seems way more daughting than it really is.

There are some quarks of Terminal that may throw people off, such as: 
- It treats _everything_ as a file (you name it: text, folders, images, _everything_)
- It is picky af and is hella case sensitive (most errors are probably because of case or because spacing was left out or added)
- Anything inside single- or double-quotes are seen as a single item
- Anything hidden will start with a period (and you're able to find them with terminal!)

It may feel like a lot but just a little time and patience and you'll be whizzing around like Neo hoping from rooftop to rooftop.
