# The Coder's Computer
If you're going to get into coding there is a set of tools that you need to have and/or be comfortable with:

1. A text editor
2. Terminal

Let's dive into each one.

### Text Editor
This is what you are going to be editing code on, and there are oodles out there to choose from. You want to make sure that you at least have the key features. The Old Coder says in his blog post, [_Choosing a Text Editor_](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) to look for code completion, syntax highlighting, a variety of themes, and wide variety of extensions. You computer probably has a text editor on it already, but they don't have the previously mentioned features that will supercharge your code writing.

With that said, you will want to a third-party editor. But which one?! Let's break down some of the most popular options:

Editor | OS | Price | Features
--- | --- | --- | ---
Notepad++ | Windows | Free | Syntax highlighting, code completion, word completion, funcion completion, zoom, online community, chat room, and searchable wiki page
TextWrangler |
BB Edit | 
Visual Studio Code | 
Atom | 
Brackets | 
Sublime Text |


### Terminal
