##Growth Mindset
It feels like growth mindset leans on neuroplasticity by learning to be with the discomfort of expanding our understanding. It also is an attitude when approaching difficulty - finding joy in obstacles in order to have a relationship with learning that leads us to move forward rather than stopping when running into new challenges.

####Summary of Reading
- Take a break when running into difficulty and then try a new approach
- Notice avoidance patterns and take contrary action
- Think about the long game and not instant gratification
- Negative bias will limit thinking so reframe negative thinking
- Don't compare yourself with others
- Growth mindset leads to longterm goals
