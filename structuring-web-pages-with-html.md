# Structuring Web Pages With HTML

### Wireframes
Building a webpage, like building a house, needs a strong foundation and sturdy structure. Most folks begin with a wireframe to map out the architecture of the site. You want to create a heirarchy for your information so the user can naturally navigate around the site with ease. 

To conceptualize your wireframe you want to take a few easy steps to set yourself up for success:

1. Research to understand your user's needs and best practices to support that
1. Map out how you anticipate your user navigating your site
1. Keep your ideas very low fidelity so you can focus on function over visuals
1. Test out your ideas
1. Build your prototype

The key to a good wireframe is simplicity. You want to make sure can easily navigate the layout and the user feels good in their abilities in using the site. This is the best way to build trust between the business and the user to keep goals being met. 

### Building Your Site
Once you feel good abour your wireframe, then you're ready to build out your site. This is where HTML comes in. HTML is the walls and roof of the site - we'll decorate later. You want to focus on building scalable code at this point of the process. 

All HTML is made up of these elements:
1. Opening tag
1. Closing tag
1. Content
1. Attribute (optional)

The elements of organized in a set structure in an `index.html` file:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

From there you want to add your content:
```
Images 
<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

Headings
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>

Paragraphs
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>

Links
<a href="https://www.url.com">Linked Text</a>

Unordered Lists
<ul>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>

Ordered Lists
<ol>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ol>
```

And now you have all the building blocks of a website!
